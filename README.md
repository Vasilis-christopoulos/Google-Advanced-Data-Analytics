This is a version using both regression and tree based models of the capstone project that was included in the Google Advanced Data Analytics Certification.
(Combination of both my personal notebook as well as the exemplar)
The goal of this project was to create a model that predicts employee retention in order to assist the HR department of Salifort Motors.


Logistic Regression

The logistic regression model achieved precision of 80%, recall of 83%, f1-score of 80% (all weighted averages), and accuracy of 83%, on the test set.

Tree-based Machine Learning

After conducting feature engineering, the decision tree model achieved AUC of 93.8%, precision of 87.0%, recall of 90.4%, f1-score of 88.7%, 
and accuracy of 96.2%, on the test set. The random forest modestly outperformed the decision tree model.


Conclusion

The models and the feature importances extracted from the models confirm that employees at the company are overworked.

To retain employees, the following recommendations could be presented to the stakeholders:

Cap the number of projects that employees can work on.
Consider promoting employees who have been with the company for atleast four years, or conduct further investigation about why four-year tenured employees are so dissatisfied.
Either reward employees for working longer hours, or don't require them to do so.
If employees aren't familiar with the company's overtime pay policies, inform them about this. 
Hold company-wide and within-team discussions to understand and address the company work culture, across the board and in specific contexts.
High evaluation scores should not be reserved for employees who work 200+ hours per month. Consider a proportionate scale for rewarding employees who contribute more/put in more effort.
